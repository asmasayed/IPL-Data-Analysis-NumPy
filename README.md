IPL Data Analysis using NumPy
This is a new concept I learned as part of my data science journey. 
Iâ€™m learning through hands-on projects, and this analysis uses an IPL dataset to apply NumPy basics. 

ðŸ“‚ Files
numpy_ipl.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with analysis
ipl_dataset.xlsx â†’ Dataset used

ðŸ”¹ Skills Practiced
Loading Excel data in Python
NumPy indexing, slicing, and filtering
Mean, median, mode, and aggregations

ðŸš€ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-Data-Analysis-NumPy.git
cd IPL-Data-Analysis-NumPy
pip install numpy pandas openpyxl
jupyter notebook numpy_ipl.ipynb

âœ¨ Next Steps
Learn data visualization as my next step in this journey
Build a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) project
